# hello-word
This is a first repository, to learn how to use GitHub
Now it's time to wrote something about me: well, the first important aspect is that my english is not so good. So, that will apperas here. Other important thing is that I am brasilian, but now I'm living in France, just to do my research, and that is the reason that I reay want to leran about GitHub. All is knew for me. It's more dificult , because even the current words that you use, are knew words for me. I'm a medical surgeon, looking for knew knowledgments.
Another commit, just to learn...
